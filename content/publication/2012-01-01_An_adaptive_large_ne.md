abstract = "The Pollution-Routing Problem (PRP) is a recently introduced extension of the classical Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows which consists of routing a number of vehicles to serve a set of customers, and determining their speed on each route segment so as to minimize a function comprising fuel, emission and driver costs. This paper presents an adaptive large neighborhood search for the PRP. Results of extensive computational experimentation confirm the efficiency of the algorithm."
