abstract = "A combination of transportation modes offers environmentally friendly alternatives to transport high volumes of freight over long distances. In order to reflect the advantages of each transportation mode, it is the challenge to deal with data uncertainty during the transportation planning phase. This chapter investigates the alternative ways of modeling the uncertainty by discussing them and their characteristics in terms of solution times, the quality, and the limitations. Moreover, several real-life case studies are provided to demonstrate potential environmental benefits by considering the principles of green logistics for single-mode and intermodal transportation."
