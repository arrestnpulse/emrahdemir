abstract = "Logistics companies need to create and deliver value in an efficient way so that they generate profit in a highly competitive and demanding market. Green thinking can help companies to take required actions to minimize negative externalities of their transportation activities and enhance their brand value. Green vehicle routing, for example, is one of the opportunities where negative externalities are explicitly considered so that these externalities are reduced or eliminated through improved planning. This chapter provides an overview of some of the current developments in road transportation, including the description of negative externalities and some of their applications in vehicle routing and scheduling."
