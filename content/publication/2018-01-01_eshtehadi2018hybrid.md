abstract = "Emissions resulted from transportation activities may lead to dangerous effects on the whole environment and human health. According to sustainability principles, in recent years researchers attempt to consider the environmental burden of logistics activities in traditional logistics problems such as vehicle routing problems (VRPs). The pollution-routing problem (PRP) is an extension of the VRP which consists of routing a number of vehicles to serve a set of customers and determining their speed on each route segment so as to minimize a function of comprising fuel, emissions and driver costs. This paper proposes an adaptive large neighborhood search for the robust PRP (RPRP) under demand uncertainty. The achieved results indicate a premium performance of the solutions obtained by the proposed robust models. "
